### 👋 About Me

Hey, You've reached Ahmad.

I've been writing code for almost a decade and have had the opportunity to work with both product- and service-based companies, as well as individual clients from around the globe.

While I've worked with a variety of technologies throughout my career, my core expertise lies in the Python and JavaScript ecosystems.

You can check out my [portfolio](https://ahmadgirach.com) - it's open source, by the way! 😉
